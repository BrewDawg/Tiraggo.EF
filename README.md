[NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Mike.Griffin/) install from within Visual Studio using the NuGet Package Manager.

##Tired of LINQ and Lamba?##
Tap into your T-SQL knowledge and write queries that actually make sense. Personally, I'm tired of stumbling upon LINQ queries that are so unintelligible and complex our team has to throw them away and start over. In addition to this is the horrid SQL generated by LINQ. And what's with this not being able to select certain columns? This is 2013 folks. Now you can have the best of both worlds; the Tiraggo Dynamic Query API and your Entity Framework entities.

##How does it work##
When you install the Tiraggo.EF NuGet package it will install two T4 templates into your Visual Studio solution. Both will run successfully but only one will generate code depending on whether you have V2 or V3 EDMX files. The templates will be installed in your Models folder. You will have to edit the T4 template and add the name of your EDMX file in both templates. Once you see which templates generates your code you can remove the other if you like.

Like so:
```csharp
// ******************************************
// *** CHANGE THIS TO YOUR EDMX FILE NAME ***
// ******************************************
string edxmFileName = @"MyModel.edmx";
```

A reference to "Tiraggo.DynamicQuery.EF.dll" will also be added to your solution. This is the only assembly your application will need to use Tiraggo.EF at runtime.

There is a "TiraggoEdmx.EF.dll" added to a folder in your project named "TiraggoEdmx", this is used by the T4 templates and you do not need to ship this assembly. It provides the low level metadata that Microsoft EDMX API refuses to server up, like the mappings between your conceptual model and the storage model including low level, primitive information like the SQL Server columns types (nvarchar) and a alike. I am making some enhancements in the assmebly and will release this as a NuGet package on it's own, it's a far superior way to write T4 templates againts EDMX files, everything it fully exposed.

You can see a sample of it [HERE](https://github.com/BrewDawg/Tiraggo.EF/blob/master/TiraggoEdmx/TiraggoEntityInfo_v3.cs). Again, I am making big improvements to this and will release in about two weeks.

##Intuitive and Familiar SQL API##
Full Intellisense Support
```csharp
EmployeeQuery q = new EmployeeQuery("e");
EmployeeQuery q1 = new EmployeeQuery("e1");

q.Select(q.EmployeeID, q.LastName)  // To bind to combobox
	.Where(q.LastName.Like("%a%"))
	.InnerJoin(q1).On(q.EmployeeID == q1.ReportsTo)
	.OrderBy(q.LastName.Descending);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Employee> employees = q.ToList<Employee>(context);
}
```

Yep, you can actually only select the columns you desire and the SQL is extremely lean. Tiraggo.EF Requires a single .NET assembly and no config settings.

NOTE: InnerJoin is used above, also supported are RightJoin, LeftJoin, CrossJoin, and FullJoin.

```sql
SELECT
   e.[EmployeeID],
   e.[LastName]  
FROM
   [Employees] e 
INNER JOIN [Employees] e1 
   ON e.[EmployeeID] = e1.[ReportsTo] 
WHERE
   e.[LastName] LIKE @LastName1 
ORDER BY
   e.[LastName] DESC
```

Compare that SQL to the SQL generated by a Entity Framework query which does the same thing and you'll be shocked.

##Supported Operators##
Use the native language syntax, it works as you expect it would.
- +
- -
- *
- /
- %
- >
- <
- <=
- >=
- =<
- ==
- != 
- && = SQL 'AND' in VB use "And"
- || = SQL 'OR' in VB use "Or"

##More Samples##

###Select Top###
```csharp
EmployeesQuery q = new EmployeesQuery();
q.tg.Top = 1;
q.Where(q.EmployeeID == 1 && (q.LastName != "googy"));

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Employee> employees = q.ToList<Employee>(context);
}
```

Result:
```sql
SELECT  TOP 1 * 
FROM [Employees] 
WHERE ([EmployeeID] = @EmployeeID1 AND [LastName] <> @LastName2)
```

###SelectAllExcept###
SelectAllExcept() is not really a SubQuery, just a convenient enhancement that allows you to select all except one or more listed columns.

```csharp
EmployeeQuery q = new EmployeeQuery();
q.SelectAllExcept(q.Photo);  // We don't want to bring back the huge photo

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Employee> employees = q.ToList<Employee>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT [EmployeeID],[LastName],[FirstName],[Supervisor],[Age]  -- not [Photo]
FROM [dbo].[Employee]
```

###Paging###

Using PageSize and PageNumber. This is the traditional way of paging and works on all versions of SQL Server. You always need an OrderBy when sorting.
```csharp
ErrorLogQuery q = new ErrorLogQuery();
q.Select(q.ErrorLogId, q.Method, q.Message);
q.OrderBy(q.DateOccurred.Descending);
q.tg.PageNumber = 2;
q.tg.PageSize = 20;

using (MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<ErrorLog> errors = q.ToList<ErrorLog>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
WITH [withStatement] AS 
(
	SELECT [errorlogid], 
		[method], 
		[message], 
		Row_number() OVER
		( 
			ORDER BY [dateoccurred] DESC
		) AS ESRN 
	FROM [dbo].[errorlog]
) 
SELECT * 
FROM [withStatement] 
WHERE esrn BETWEEN 21 AND 40 
ORDER BY esrn ASC 
```

Using Skip and Take for paging. Requires Microsoft SQL 2012 at a minimum.

```csharp
ErrorLogQuery q = new ErrorLogQuery();
q.Select(q.ErrorLogId, q.Method, q.Message);
q.OrderBy(q.DateOccurred.Descending);
q.Skip(40).Take(20);

using (MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<ErrorLog> errors = q.ToList<ErrorLog>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT [ErrorLogId],[Method],[Message]  
FROM [dbo].[ErrorLog] 
ORDER BY [DateOccurred] DESC 
OFFSET 40 ROWS 
FETCH NEXT 20 ROWS ONLY
```

###With NoLock###

```csharp
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
OrderItemQuery oiq = new OrderItemQuery("oi");

oq.Select(oq.CustID, oq.OrderDate, "<sub.OrderTotal>");
oq.From
    (
        oiq.Select(oiq.OrderID,
            (oiq.UnitPrice * oiq.Quantity).Sum().As("OrderTotal"))
            .GroupBy(oiq.OrderID)
    ).As("sub");
oq.InnerJoin(oq).On(oq.OrderID == oiq.OrderID);
oq.es.WithNoLock = true;

using (MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = q.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Notice that even though many query objects are being used you only need to set WithNoLock to true for the parent or main query object. The SQL generated is as follows:

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[CustID],o.[OrderDate],sub.OrderTotal  
FROM 
(
   SELECT oi.[OrderID],SUM((oi.[UnitPrice]*oi.[Quantity])) AS 'OrderTotal'  
   FROM [OrderItem] oi WITH (NOLOCK) 
   GROUP BY oi.[OrderID]
) AS sub 
INNER JOIN [Order] o WITH (NOLOCK) 
ON o.[OrderID] = sub.[OrderID] 
```

###Full Expressions in OrderBy and GroupBy###

This query doesn’t really make sense, but we wanted to show you what will be possible in the next release.

```csharp
EmployeesQuery q = new EmployeesQuery(); 
q.Select(q.LastName.Substring(2, 4).ToLower()); 
q.OrderBy(q.LastName.Substring(2, 4).ToLower().Descending); 
q.GroupBy(q.LastName.Substring(2, 4).ToLower());

using (MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<ErrorLog> errors = q.ToList<ErrorLog>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING(LOWER([LastName]),2,4) AS 'LastName' 
FROM [Employees] 
GROUP BY SUBSTRING(LOWER([LastName]),2,4) 
ORDER BY SUBSTRING(LOWER([LastName]),2,4) DESC
```

###Select SubQuery###

A SubQuery in a Select clause must return a single value.

```csharp
OrderQuery orders = new OrderQuery("o");
OrderItemQuery details = new OrderItemQuery("oi");

orders.Select
(
    orders.OrderID,
    orders.OrderDate,
    details.Select
	(
        details.UnitPrice.Max()
	)
    .Where(orders.OrderID == details.OrderID).As("MaxUnitPrice")
);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> theOrders = orders.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[OrderID],o.[OrderDate], 
(
	SELECT MAX(oi.[UnitPrice]) AS 'UnitPrice'  
	FROM [dbo].[OrderItem] oi 
	WHERE o.[OrderID] = oi.[OrderID]
) AS MaxUnitPrice  
FROM [dbo].[Order] o
```

This is the same as the query above, but returns all columns in the Order table, instead of just OrderID and OrderDate. Notice that the Select clause contains orders, not orders.*. The SQL produced will use the supplied alias o.*.

```csharp
OrderQuery orders = new OrderQuery("o");
OrderItemQuery details = new OrderItemQuery("oi");

orders.Select
(
    orders, // this means orders.*
    details.Select
	(
        details.UnitPrice.Max()
	)
    .Where(orders.OrderID == details.OrderID).As("MaxUnitPrice")
);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> theOrders = orders.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.* 
(
	SELECT MAX(oi.[UnitPrice]) AS 'UnitPrice'  
	FROM [dbo].[OrderItem] oi 
	WHERE o.[OrderID] = oi.[OrderID]
) AS MaxUnitPrice  
FROM [ForeignKeyTest].[dbo].[Order] o
```

###From SubQuery###

An aggregate requires a GROUP BY for each column in the SELECT that is not an aggregate. Sometimes you wish to include columns in your result set that you do not wish to group by. One way to accomplish this is by using a SubQuery in the From clause that contains the aggregate the way you want it grouped. The outer query contains the results of the aggregate, plus any additional columns.

If you use a SubQuery in a From clause, you must give the From clause its own alias (shown below as "sub"). In the outer query, to refer to an aliased element in the From SubQuery, use the inline raw SQL technique to qualify the aggregate's alias with the From clause alias, i.e., "<sub.OrderTotal>".

```csharp
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
OrderItemQuery oiq = new OrderItemQuery("oi");

oq.Select(oq.CustID, oq.OrderDate, "<sub.OrderTotal>");
oq.From
(
	oiq.Select
	(
		oiq.OrderID,
		(oiq.UnitPrice * oiq.Quantity).Sum().As("OrderTotal")
	)
	.GroupBy(oiq.OrderID)
).As("sub");
oq.InnerJoin(oq).On(oq.OrderID == oiq.OrderID);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> oq = orders.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[CustID],o.[OrderDate],sub.OrderTotal  
FROM 
(
	SELECT oi.[OrderID],
	SUM((oi.[UnitPrice]*oi.[Quantity])) AS 'OrderTotal'  
	FROM [dbo].[OrderItem] oi 
	GROUP BY oi.[OrderID]
) AS sub 
INNER JOIN [dbo].[Order] o ON o.[OrderID] = sub.[OrderID]
```

###Where SubQuery###

In and NotIn are two of the most common operators used in a Where SubQuery. The following produces a result set containing Territories that an Employee is not associated with.

```csharp
// SubQuery of Territories that Employee 1 is assigned to.
EmployeeTerritoryQuery etq = new EmployeeTerritoryQuery("et");
etq.Select(etq.TerrID);
etq.Where(etq.EmpID == 1);

// Territories that Employee 1 is not assigned to.
TerritoryQuery tq = new TerritoryQuery("t");
tq.Select(tq.Description);
tq.Where(tq.TerritoryID.NotIn(etq));

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Territory> territories = tq.ToList<Territory>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT t.[Description]  
FROM [dbo].[Territory] t 
WHERE t.[TerritoryID] NOT IN 
(
    SELECT et.[TerrID]  
    FROM .[dbo].[EmployeeTerritory] et 
    WHERE et.[EmpID] = @EmpID1
) 
```

Exists evaluates to true, if the SubQuery returns a result set.

```csharp
// SubQuery of Employees with a null Supervisor column.
EmployeeQuery sq = new EmployeeQuery("s");
sq.tg.Distinct = true;
sq.Select(sq.EmployeeID);
sq.Where(sq.Supervisor.IsNull());

// If even one employee has a null supervisor,
// i.e., the above query has a result set,
// then run a list of all employees.
EmployeeQuery eq = new EmployeeQuery("e");
eq.Select(eq.EmployeeID, eq.Supervisor);
eq.Where(eq.Exists(sq));

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Employee> employees = eq.ToList<Employee>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT e.[EmployeeID],e.[Supervisor]  
FROM [dbo].[Employee] e 
WHERE EXISTS 
(
    SELECT DISTINCT s.[EmployeeID]  
    FROM [dbo].[Employee] s 
    WHERE s.[Supervisor] IS NULL
)
```

###Join(query).On(SubQuery)###

SubQueries cannot be used directly within a Join(SubQuery) clause, but they can be used within a Join(query).On(SubQuery) clause.

```csharp
// Query for the Join
OrderItemQuery oiq = new OrderItemQuery("oi");

// SubQuery of OrderItems with a discount
OrderItemQuery oisq = new OrderItemQuery("ois");
oisq.tg.Distinct = true;
oisq.Select(oisq.Discount);
oisq.Where(oisq.Discount > 0);

// Orders with discounted items
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
oq.Select(oq.OrderID, oiq.Discount);
oq.InnerJoin(oiq).On(oq.OrderID == oiq.OrderID && oiq.Discount.In(oisq));
	
using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = oq.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[OrderID],oi.[Discount]  
FROM [dbo].[Order] o 
INNER JOIN [dbo].[OrderItem] oi 
ON (o.[OrderID] = oi.[OrderID] AND oi.[Discount] IN  
(
    SELECT  DISTINCT ois.[Discount]  
    FROM [dbo].[OrderItem] ois 
    WHERE ois.[Discount] > @Discount1)
)
```

###Correlated SubQuery###

A correlated SubQuery is where the inner query relies on an element of the outer query. The inner select cannot run on its own. Below, the inner pq query uses the outer query's oiq.ProductID in the Where() clause.

```csharp
OrderItemQuery oiq = new OrderItemQuery("oi");
ProductQuery pq = new ProductQuery("p");

oiq.Select(
    oiq.OrderID,
    (oiq.Quantity * oiq.UnitPrice).Sum().As("Total")
);
oiq.Where(oiq.ProductID
    .In(
        pq.Select(pq.ProductID)
        .Where(oiq.ProductID == pq.ProductID)
    )
);
oiq.GroupBy(oiq.OrderID);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = oiq.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT oi.[OrderID],SUM((oi.[Quantity]*oi.[UnitPrice])) AS 'Total'  
FROM [dbo].[OrderItem] oi 
WHERE oi.[ProductID] IN 
(
    SELECT p.[ProductID]  
    FROM [dbo].[Product] p 
    WHERE oi.[ProductID] = p.[ProductID]
)  
GROUP BY oi.[OrderID]
```

###Nested SubQuery###

Tiraggo supports nesting of SubQueries. Each database vendor has their own limits on just how deep the nesting can go. Tiraggo supports two different syntax approaches to nested SubQueries.

Traditional SQL-style syntax is most useful if you already have a query designed using standard SQL, and are just converting it to a DynamicQuery.

```csharp
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
CustomerQuery cq = new CustomerQuery("c");
EmployeeQuery eq = new EmployeeQuery("e");

// OrderID and CustID for customers who ordered on the same date
// a customer was added, and have a manager whose 
// last name starts with 'S'.
oq.Select(
    oq.OrderID,
    oq.CustID
);
oq.Where(oq.OrderDate
    .In(
        cq.Select(cq.DateAdded)
        .Where(cq.Manager.In(
            eq.Select(eq.EmployeeID)
            .Where(eq.LastName.Like("S%"))
            )
        )
    )
);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = oq.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[OrderID],o.[CustID]  
FROM [dbo].[Order] o 
WHERE o.[OrderDate] IN 
(
	SELECT c.[DateAdded]  
	FROM [dbo].[Customer] c 
	WHERE c.[Manager] IN 
	(
		SELECT e.[EmployeeID]  
		FROM [dbo].[Employee] e 
		WHERE e.[LastName] LIKE @LastName1
	) 
)
```

Nesting by query instance name can be easier to understand and construct, if you are starting from scratch, and have no pre-existing SQL to go by. The trick is to start with the inner-most SubQuery and work your way out. The query below produces the same results as the traditional SQL-style query above. The instance names are color coded to emphasize how they are nested.

```csharp
// Employees whose LastName begins with 'S'.
EmployeeQuery eq = new EmployeeQuery("e");
eq.Select(eq.EmployeeID);
eq.Where(eq.LastName.Like("S%"));

// DateAdded for Customers whose Managers are in the
// EmployeeQuery above.
CustomerQuery cq = new CustomerQuery("c");
cq.Select(cq.DateAdded);
cq.Where(cq.Manager.In(eq));

// OrderID and CustID where the OrderDate is in the
// CustomerQuery above.
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
oq.Select(oq.OrderID, oq.CustID);
oq.Where(oq.OrderDate.In(cq));

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = oq.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[OrderID],o.[CustID]  
FROM [dbo].[Order] o 
WHERE o.[OrderDate] IN 
(
    SELECT c.[DateAdded]  
    FROM [dbo].[Customer] c 
    WHERE c.[Manager] IN 
	(
        SELECT e.[EmployeeID]  
        FROM [dbo].[Employee] e 
        WHERE e.[LastName] LIKE @LastName1
	)
)
```

###Any, All, and Some###

ANY, ALL, and SOME are SubQuery qualifiers. They precede the SubQuery they apply to. For most databases, ANY and SOME are synonymous. Usually, if you use an operator (>, >=, =, <, <=) in a Where clause against a SubQuery, then the SubQuery must return a single value. By applying a qualifier to the SubQuery, you can use operators against SubQueries that return multiple results.

Notice, below, that the ALL qualifier is set to true for the SubQuery with "cq.tg.All = true;".

```csharp
// DateAdded for Customers whose Manager  = 3
CustomerQuery cq = new CustomerQuery("c");
cq.tg.All = true;
cq.Select(cq.DateAdded);
cq.Where(cq.Manager == 3);

// OrderID and CustID where the OrderDate is 
// less than all of the dates in the CustomerQuery above.
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
oq.Select(oq.OrderID, oq.CustID);
oq.Where(oq.OrderDate < cq);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = oq.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[OrderID],o.[CustID]  
FROM [dbo].[Order] o 
WHERE o.[OrderDate] < ALL 
(
    SELECT c.[DateAdded]  
    FROM [ForeignKeyTest].[dbo].[Customer] c 
    WHERE c.[Manager] = @Manager1
)
```

Below, is a nested SubQuery. The ANY qualifier is set to true for the middle SubQuery with "cq.tg.Any = true;".

```csharp
// Employees whose LastName begins with 'S'.
EmployeeQuery eq = new EmployeeQuery("e");
eq.Select(eq.EmployeeID);
eq.Where(eq.LastName.Like("S%"));

// DateAdded for Customers whose Managers are in the
// EmployeeQuery above.
CustomerQuery cq = new CustomerQuery("c");
cq.tg.Any = true;
cq.Select(cq.DateAdded);
cq.Where(cq.Manager.In(eq));

// OrderID and CustID where the OrderDate is 
// less than any one of the dates in the CustomerQuery above.
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
oq.Select(oq.OrderID, oq.CustID);
oq.Where(oq.OrderDate < cq);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = oq.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[OrderID],o.[CustID]  
FROM [dbo].[Order] o 
WHERE o.[OrderDate] < ANY 
(
    SELECT c.[DateAdded]  
    FROM [dbo].[Customer] c 
    WHERE c.[Manager] IN 
	(
        SELECT e.[EmployeeID]  
        FROM [dbo].[Employee] e 
        WHERE e.[LastName] LIKE @LastName1
	)
)
```

###Case().When().Then().End() Syntax###

```csharp
EmployeesQuery q = new EmployeesQuery();
q.Select(q.EmployeeID, q.FirstName);
q.Where(q.EmployeeID == 2);
 
OrderDetailsQuery oq = new OrderDetailsQuery();
oq.Select
(
    oq.UnitPrice.Case()
        .When("yay").Then("wow")
        .When(oq.Exists(q)).Then("Exists!!")
        .When(oq.Quantity >= 50).Then(oq.UnitPrice)
        .When(oq.Quantity  / 50 / 50 == 0).Then(oq.UnitPrice)
        .When(oq.Quantity >= 50 && oq.Quantity < 250).Then(1)
        .When(oq.Quantity >= 250 && oq.Quantity < 1000).Then(oq.UnitPrice * .80)
        .Else("Huh?")
        .End()
);
oq.Where(oq.Quantity.Sum() >= 50 && oq.Quantity.Avg() < 250);
oq.OrderBy(oq.OrderID.Descending, oq.Quantity.Descending);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<OrderDetails> details = oq.ToList<OrderDetails>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE UnitPrice  
        WHEN 'yay' THEN 'wow' 
        WHEN  EXISTS (
                SELECT [EmployeeID],[FirstName]  
                FROM [Employees] 
                WHERE [EmployeeID] = @EmployeeID1)  THEN 'Exists!!' 
        WHEN [Quantity] >= @Quantity2 THEN [UnitPrice] 
        WHEN (([Quantity] / 50) / 50) = @Expr3 THEN [UnitPrice] 
        WHEN ([Quantity] >= @Quantity4 AND [Quantity] < @Quantity5) THEN 1 
        WHEN ([Quantity] >= @Quantity6 AND [Quantity] < @Quantity7) THEN ([UnitPrice] * 0.8) 
        ELSE 'Huh?'  
    END    
FROM [Order Details] 
WHERE (SUM([Quantity]) >= @Quantity8 AND AVG([Quantity]) < @Quantity9) 
ORDER BY [OrderID] DESC,[Quantity] DESC
```

Another Case/When Query

```csharp
EmployeeQuery q = new EmployeeQuery();

q.Select
(
    q.LastName
        .Case()
            .When(q.LastName.Like("%a%")).Then("Last Name Contains an A")
            .Else("Last Name Doesnt Contain an A")
        .End().As("SpecialLastName")
);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Employee> employees = q.ToList<Employee>(context);
}
```

###Having Clause###

```csharp
EmployeeQuery q = new EmployeeQuery();
q.Select(q.EmployeeID, q.Age.Sum().As("TotalAge"));
q.Where(q.EmployeeID.IsNotNull());
q.GroupBy(q.EmployeeID);
q.Having(q.Age.Sum() > 5);
q.OrderBy(q.EmployeeID.Descending);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Employee> employees = q.ToList<Employee>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT [EmployeeID] AS 'EmployeeID',SUM([Age]) AS 'TotalAge' 
FROM [dbo].[Employee] 
WHERE[EmployeeID] IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY [EmployeeID] 
HAVING SUM([Age]) > @Age2 
ORDER BY [EmployeeID] DESC
```

###Union, Intersect, and Except###

These might be kind of silly but they demonstrate syntax.

Union
```csharp
EmployeeQuery eq1 = new EmployeeQuery("eq1");
EmployeeQuery eq2 = new EmployeeQuery("eq2");

// This leaves out the record with Age 30
eq1.Where(eq1.Age < 30);
eq1.Union(eq2);
eq2.Where(eq2.Age > 30);
```

Intersect
```csharp
EmployeeQuery eq1 = new EmployeeQuery("eq1");
EmployeeQuery eq2 = new EmployeeQuery("eq2");

// This leaves out the record with Age 30
eq1.Where(eq1.FirstName.Like("%n%"));
eq1.Intersect(eq2);
eq2.Where(eq2.FirstName.Like("%a%"));
```

Except
```csharp
EmployeeQuery eq1 = new EmployeeQuery("eq1");
EmployeeQuery eq2 = new EmployeeQuery("eq2");

// This leaves out the record with Age 30
eq1.Where(eq1.FirstName.Like("%J%"));
eq1.Except(eq2);
eq2.Where(eq2.FirstName == "Jim");
```

###Raw SQL Injection Everywhere###

There may be times when you need to access some SQL feature that is not supported by the DynamicQuery API. But, now having used and fallen in love with DynamicQuery, the last thing you want to do is stop and go write a stored procedure or create a view. We have always supported the raw injection feature in our Select statement, but it will soon be available almost everywhere. The way it works is you pass in raw SQL in the form of a string surrounded by < > angle brackets. That indicates that you want the raw SQL passed directly to the database engine “as is”.

Here is an example query. You would never write a query like this in reality. Tiraggo supports this simple query without having to use < > angle brackets. This is just to show all of the places that can accept the raw SQL injection technique:

```csharp
EmployeesQuery q = new EmployeesQuery();
q.Select("<FirstName>", q.HireDate);
q.Where("<EmployeeID = 1>");
q.GroupBy("<FirstName>", q.HireDate);
q.OrderBy("<FirstName ASC>"); 

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Employee> employees = q.ToList<Employee>(context);
}
```

The SQL Generated is as follows (and works)

Results:
```sql
SELECT FirstName,[HireDate] AS 'HireDate'  
FROM [Employees] WHERE (EmployeeID = 1) 
GROUP BY FirstName,[HireDate] 
ORDER BY FirstName ASC
```

Of course, you could easily write the above query without injection, but you get the idea. The escape hatch will be available to you almost everywhere ….

```csharp
EmployeesQuery q = new EmployeesQuery();
q.Select(q.FirstName);
q.Where(q.EmployeeID == 1);
q.OrderBy(q.FirstName.Ascending);
q.GroupBy(q.FirstName, q.HireDate);
```

Using the raw SQL injection techniques above will allow you to invoke SQL functions that we don’t support, including database vender specific SQL, and so on. Hopefully, you will almost never have to resort to writing a custom load method to invoke a stored procedure or an entirely hand written SQL statement. Of course, you can use our native API everywhere and just inject the raw SQL on the GroupBy for instance. You can mix and match to get the desired SQL.

##Some Final Thoughts##

The examples given above were designed to demonstrate (and test) usage in a variety of settings. They are not necessarily the simplest, or most efficient, way to achieve the desired result set. Think of them as an API usage guide, not as design guidelines. Most SubQueries can be re-written as Joins, and most Joins can be re-written as SubQueries. If, while coding, you are having trouble conceptualizing one approach, then try the other.

Technically, a JOIN's ON clause can take almost any where_condition, and Tiraggo supports many of these, including SubQueries. But, I agree with most authorities on the subject, that the ON clause should be reserved for the conditions that relate the two tables. All other conditional statements should be placed in a WHERE clause. Typically, the ON clause only contains a column from each table and a comparison operator.

For example, take the Join(query).On(SubQuery) example above. The much simpler query below returns the same result set. Its Where() clause not only simplifies the On() clause, but eliminates the SubQuery completely.

```csharp
// Query for the Join
OrderItemQuery oiq = new OrderItemQuery("oi");

// Orders with discounted items
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
oq.Select(oq.OrderID, oiq.Discount);
oq.InnerJoin(oiq).On(oq.OrderID == oiq.OrderID);
oq.Where(oiq.Discount > 0);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = oq.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```
