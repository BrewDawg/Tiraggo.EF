##Tired of LINQ and Lamba?##
Tired of writing complex, unintuitive Linq and Lambda expressions? Why not tap into your knowledge of writing SQL queries. Now you can have the best of both worlds, the Tiraggo Dynamic Query API and your Entity Framework entities.

##Intuitive and Familiar SQL API##
Full Intellisense Support
```csharp
EmployeeQuery q = new EmployeeQuery("e");
EmployeeQuery q1 = new EmployeeQuery("e1");

q.Select(q.EmployeeID, q.LastName)  // To bind to combobox
	.Where(q.LastName.Like("%a%"))
	.InnerJoin(q1).On(q.EmployeeID == q1.ReportsTo)
	.OrderBy(q.LastName.Descending);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Employee> employees = q.ToList<Employee>(context);
}
```

Yep, you can actually only select the columns you desire and the SQL is extremely lean. Requires a single .NET assembly. NuGet package on the way ...

```sql
SELECT
   e.[EmployeeID],
   e.[LastName]  
FROM
   [Employees] e 
INNER JOIN [Employees] e1 
   ON e.[EmployeeID] = e1.[ReportsTo] 
WHERE
   e.[LastName] LIKE @LastName1 
ORDER BY
   e.[LastName] DESC
```

Compare that SQL to the SQL generated by a Entity Framework query which does the same thing and you'll be shocked.

##More Samples##

###SelectAllExcept###
SelectAllExcept() is not really a SubQuery, just a convenient enhancement that allows you to select all except one or more listed columns.

```csharp
EmployeeQuery q = new EmployeeQuery();
q.SelectAllExcept(q.Photo);  // We don't want to bring back the huge photo

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Employee> employees = q.ToList<Employee>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT [EmployeeID],[LastName],[FirstName],[Supervisor],[Age]  -- not [Photo]
FROM [dbo].[Employee]
```

###Select SubQuery###

A SubQuery in a Select clause must return a single value.

```csharp
OrderQuery orders = new OrderQuery("o");
OrderItemQuery details = new OrderItemQuery("oi");

orders.Select
(
    orders.OrderID,
    orders.OrderDate,
    details.Select
	(
        details.UnitPrice.Max()
	)
    .Where(orders.OrderID == details.OrderID).As("MaxUnitPrice")
);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> theOrders = orders.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[OrderID],o.[OrderDate], 
(
	SELECT MAX(oi.[UnitPrice]) AS 'UnitPrice'  
	FROM [dbo].[OrderItem] oi 
	WHERE o.[OrderID] = oi.[OrderID]
) AS MaxUnitPrice  
FROM [dbo].[Order] o
```

This is the same as the query above, but returns all columns in the Order table, instead of just OrderID and OrderDate. Notice that the Select clause contains orders, not orders.*. The SQL produced will use the supplied alias o.*.

```csharp
OrderQuery orders = new OrderQuery("o");
OrderItemQuery details = new OrderItemQuery("oi");

orders.Select
(
    orders, // this means orders.*
    details.Select
	(
        details.UnitPrice.Max()
	)
    .Where(orders.OrderID == details.OrderID).As("MaxUnitPrice")
);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> theOrders = orders.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.* 
(
	SELECT MAX(oi.[UnitPrice]) AS 'UnitPrice'  
	FROM [dbo].[OrderItem] oi 
	WHERE o.[OrderID] = oi.[OrderID]
) AS MaxUnitPrice  
FROM [ForeignKeyTest].[dbo].[Order] o
```

###From SubQuery###

An aggregate requires a GROUP BY for each column in the SELECT that is not an aggregate. Sometimes you wish to include columns in your result set that you do not wish to group by. One way to accomplish this is by using a SubQuery in the From clause that contains the aggregate the way you want it grouped. The outer query contains the results of the aggregate, plus any additional columns.

If you use a SubQuery in a From clause, you must give the From clause its own alias (shown below as "sub"). In the outer query, to refer to an aliased element in the From SubQuery, use the inline raw SQL technique to qualify the aggregate's alias with the From clause alias, i.e., "<sub.OrderTotal>".

```csharp
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
OrderItemQuery oiq = new OrderItemQuery("oi");

oq.Select(oq.CustID, oq.OrderDate, "<sub.OrderTotal>");
oq.From
(
	oiq.Select
	(
		oiq.OrderID,
		(oiq.UnitPrice * oiq.Quantity).Sum().As("OrderTotal")
	)
	.GroupBy(oiq.OrderID)
).As("sub");
oq.InnerJoin(oq).On(oq.OrderID == oiq.OrderID);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> oq = orders.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[CustID],o.[OrderDate],sub.OrderTotal  
FROM 
(
	SELECT oi.[OrderID],
	SUM((oi.[UnitPrice]*oi.[Quantity])) AS 'OrderTotal'  
	FROM [dbo].[OrderItem] oi 
	GROUP BY oi.[OrderID]
) AS sub 
INNER JOIN [dbo].[Order] o ON o.[OrderID] = sub.[OrderID]
```

###Where SubQuery###

In and NotIn are two of the most common operators used in a Where SubQuery. The following produces a result set containing Territories that an Employee is not associated with.

```csharp
// SubQuery of Territories that Employee 1 is assigned to.
EmployeeTerritoryQuery etq = new EmployeeTerritoryQuery("et");
etq.Select(etq.TerrID);
etq.Where(etq.EmpID == 1);

// Territories that Employee 1 is not assigned to.
TerritoryQuery tq = new TerritoryQuery("t");
tq.Select(tq.Description);
tq.Where(tq.TerritoryID.NotIn(etq));

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Territory> territories = tq.ToList<Territory>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT t.[Description]  
FROM [dbo].[Territory] t 
WHERE t.[TerritoryID] NOT IN 
(
    SELECT et.[TerrID]  
    FROM .[dbo].[EmployeeTerritory] et 
    WHERE et.[EmpID] = @EmpID1
) 
```

Exists evaluates to true, if the SubQuery returns a result set.

```csharp
// SubQuery of Employees with a null Supervisor column.
EmployeeQuery sq = new EmployeeQuery("s");
sq.tg.Distinct = true;
sq.Select(sq.EmployeeID);
sq.Where(sq.Supervisor.IsNull());

// If even one employee has a null supervisor,
// i.e., the above query has a result set,
// then run a list of all employees.
EmployeeQuery eq = new EmployeeQuery("e");
eq.Select(eq.EmployeeID, eq.Supervisor);
eq.Where(eq.Exists(sq));

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Employee> employees = eq.ToList<Employee>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT e.[EmployeeID],e.[Supervisor]  
FROM [dbo].[Employee] e 
WHERE EXISTS 
(
    SELECT DISTINCT s.[EmployeeID]  
    FROM [dbo].[Employee] s 
    WHERE s.[Supervisor] IS NULL
)
```

###Join(query).On(SubQuery)###

SubQueries cannot be used directly within a Join(SubQuery) clause, but they can be used within a Join(query).On(SubQuery) clause.

```csharp
// Query for the Join
OrderItemQuery oiq = new OrderItemQuery("oi");

// SubQuery of OrderItems with a discount
OrderItemQuery oisq = new OrderItemQuery("ois");
oisq.tg.Distinct = true;
oisq.Select(oisq.Discount);
oisq.Where(oisq.Discount > 0);

// Orders with discounted items
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
oq.Select(oq.OrderID, oiq.Discount);
oq.InnerJoin(oiq).On(oq.OrderID == oiq.OrderID && oiq.Discount.In(oisq));
	
using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = oq.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[OrderID],oi.[Discount]  
FROM [dbo].[Order] o 
INNER JOIN [dbo].[OrderItem] oi 
ON (o.[OrderID] = oi.[OrderID] AND oi.[Discount] IN  
(
    SELECT  DISTINCT ois.[Discount]  
    FROM [dbo].[OrderItem] ois 
    WHERE ois.[Discount] > @Discount1)
)
```

###Correlated SubQuery###

A correlated SubQuery is where the inner query relies on an element of the outer query. The inner select cannot run on its own. Below, the inner pq query uses the outer query's oiq.ProductID in the Where() clause.

```csharp
OrderItemQuery oiq = new OrderItemQuery("oi");
ProductQuery pq = new ProductQuery("p");

oiq.Select(
    oiq.OrderID,
    (oiq.Quantity * oiq.UnitPrice).Sum().As("Total")
);
oiq.Where(oiq.ProductID
    .In(
        pq.Select(pq.ProductID)
        .Where(oiq.ProductID == pq.ProductID)
    )
);
oiq.GroupBy(oiq.OrderID);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = oiq.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT oi.[OrderID],SUM((oi.[Quantity]*oi.[UnitPrice])) AS 'Total'  
FROM [dbo].[OrderItem] oi 
WHERE oi.[ProductID] IN 
(
    SELECT p.[ProductID]  
    FROM [dbo].[Product] p 
    WHERE oi.[ProductID] = p.[ProductID]
)  
GROUP BY oi.[OrderID]
```

###Nested SubQuery###

EntitySpaces supports nesting of SubQueries. Each database vendor has their own limits on just how deep the nesting can go. EntitySpaces supports two different syntax approaches to nested SubQueries.

Traditional SQL-style syntax is most useful if you already have a query designed using standard SQL, and are just converting it to a DynamicQuery.

```csharp
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
CustomerQuery cq = new CustomerQuery("c");
EmployeeQuery eq = new EmployeeQuery("e");

// OrderID and CustID for customers who ordered on the same date
// a customer was added, and have a manager whose 
// last name starts with 'S'.
oq.Select(
    oq.OrderID,
    oq.CustID
);
oq.Where(oq.OrderDate
    .In(
        cq.Select(cq.DateAdded)
        .Where(cq.Manager.In(
            eq.Select(eq.EmployeeID)
            .Where(eq.LastName.Like("S%"))
            )
        )
    )
);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = oq.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[OrderID],o.[CustID]  
FROM [dbo].[Order] o 
WHERE o.[OrderDate] IN 
(
	SELECT c.[DateAdded]  
	FROM [dbo].[Customer] c 
	WHERE c.[Manager] IN 
	(
		SELECT e.[EmployeeID]  
		FROM [dbo].[Employee] e 
		WHERE e.[LastName] LIKE @LastName1
	) 
)
```

Nesting by query instance name can be easier to understand and construct, if you are starting from scratch, and have no pre-existing SQL to go by. The trick is to start with the inner-most SubQuery and work your way out. The query below produces the same results as the traditional SQL-style query above. The instance names are color coded to emphasize how they are nested.

```csharp
// Employees whose LastName begins with 'S'.
EmployeeQuery eq = new EmployeeQuery("e");
eq.Select(eq.EmployeeID);
eq.Where(eq.LastName.Like("S%"));

// DateAdded for Customers whose Managers are in the
// EmployeeQuery above.
CustomerQuery cq = new CustomerQuery("c");
cq.Select(cq.DateAdded);
cq.Where(cq.Manager.In(eq));

// OrderID and CustID where the OrderDate is in the
// CustomerQuery above.
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
oq.Select(oq.OrderID, oq.CustID);
oq.Where(oq.OrderDate.In(cq));

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = oq.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[OrderID],o.[CustID]  
FROM [dbo].[Order] o 
WHERE o.[OrderDate] IN 
(
    SELECT c.[DateAdded]  
    FROM [dbo].[Customer] c 
    WHERE c.[Manager] IN 
	(
        SELECT e.[EmployeeID]  
        FROM [dbo].[Employee] e 
        WHERE e.[LastName] LIKE @LastName1
	)
)
```

###Any, All, and Some###

ANY, ALL, and SOME are SubQuery qualifiers. They precede the SubQuery they apply to. For most databases, ANY and SOME are synonymous. Usually, if you use an operator (>, >=, =, <, <=) in a Where clause against a SubQuery, then the SubQuery must return a single value. By applying a qualifier to the SubQuery, you can use operators against SubQueries that return multiple results.

Notice, below, that the ALL qualifier is set to true for the SubQuery with "cq.es.All = true;".

```csharp
// DateAdded for Customers whose Manager  = 3
CustomerQuery cq = new CustomerQuery("c");
cq.tg.All = true;
cq.Select(cq.DateAdded);
cq.Where(cq.Manager == 3);

// OrderID and CustID where the OrderDate is 
// less than all of the dates in the CustomerQuery above.
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
oq.Select(oq.OrderID, oq.CustID);
oq.Where(oq.OrderDate < cq);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = oq.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[OrderID],o.[CustID]  
FROM [dbo].[Order] o 
WHERE o.[OrderDate] < ALL 
(
    SELECT c.[DateAdded]  
    FROM [ForeignKeyTest].[dbo].[Customer] c 
    WHERE c.[Manager] = @Manager1
)
```

Below, is a nested SubQuery. The ANY qualifier is set to true for the middle SubQuery with "cq.es.Any = true;".

```csharp
// Employees whose LastName begins with 'S'.
EmployeeQuery eq = new EmployeeQuery("e");
eq.Select(eq.EmployeeID);
eq.Where(eq.LastName.Like("S%"));

// DateAdded for Customers whose Managers are in the
// EmployeeQuery above.
CustomerQuery cq = new CustomerQuery("c");
cq.tg.Any = true;
cq.Select(cq.DateAdded);
cq.Where(cq.Manager.In(eq));

// OrderID and CustID where the OrderDate is 
// less than any one of the dates in the CustomerQuery above.
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
oq.Select(oq.OrderID, oq.CustID);
oq.Where(oq.OrderDate < cq);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = oq.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```

Results:
```sql
SELECT o.[OrderID],o.[CustID]  
FROM [dbo].[Order] o 
WHERE o.[OrderDate] < ANY 
(
    SELECT c.[DateAdded]  
    FROM [dbo].[Customer] c 
    WHERE c.[Manager] IN 
	(
        SELECT e.[EmployeeID]  
        FROM [dbo].[Employee] e 
        WHERE e.[LastName] LIKE @LastName1
	)
)
```
		
Some Final Thoughts

The examples given above were designed to demonstrate (and test) usage in a variety of settings. They are not necessarily the simplest, or most efficient, way to achieve the desired result set. Think of them as an API usage guide, not as design guidelines. Most SubQueries can be re-written as Joins, and most Joins can be re-written as SubQueries. If, while coding, you are having trouble conceptualizing one approach, then try the other.

Technically, a JOIN's ON clause can take almost any where_condition, and EntitySpaces supports many of these, including SubQueries. But, we agree with most authorities on the subject, that the ON clause should be reserved for the conditions that relate the two tables. All other conditional statements should be placed in a WHERE clause. Typically, the ON clause only contains a column from each table and a comparison operator.

For example, take the Join(query).On(SubQuery) example above. The much simpler query below returns the same result set. Its Where() clause not only simplifies the On() clause, but eliminates the SubQuery completely.

```csharp
// Query for the Join
OrderItemQuery oiq = new OrderItemQuery("oi");

// Orders with discounted items
OrderQuery oq = new OrderQuery("o");
oq.Select(oq.OrderID, oiq.Discount);
oq.InnerJoin(oiq).On(oq.OrderID == oiq.OrderID);
oq.Where(oiq.Discount > 0);

using(MyEntities context = new MyEntities())
{
	IList<Order> orders = oq.ToList<Order>(context);
}
```
